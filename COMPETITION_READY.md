## 🎯 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Fork the Repository (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Go to GitHub
https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-react-template

# 2. Click "Fork" button

# 3. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fhevm-react-template.git
cd fhevm-react-template

# 4. Copy prepared files

# to your cloned repository
```

### Step 2: Implement SDK Core (2-3 hours)

**Priority Files**:

1. `packages/fhevm-sdk/src/core/client.ts`
   ```typescript
   export async function createFhevmInstance(config) {
     // Implementation using fhevmjs
   }
   ```

2. `packages/fhevm-sdk/src/core/encryption.ts`
   ```typescript
   export async function encryptInput(fhevm, value, type?) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

3. `packages/fhevm-sdk/src/core/decryption.ts`
   ```typescript
   export async function decryptOutput(fhevm, ciphertext, contractAddress) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

4. `packages/fhevm-sdk/src/react/useFhevm.ts`
   ```typescript
   export function useFhevm(config) {
     // React hook implementation
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Import Housing Assessment Example (1 hour)

Follow `IMPORT_GUIDE.md`:

```bash
cd examples
mkdir nextjs-housing-assessment
cd nextjs-housing-assessment


# Update to use @fhevm/sdk
```

### Step 4: Build and Test (30 minutes)

```bash
# Build SDK
cd packages/fhevm-sdk
npm install
npm run build

# Test example
cd ../../examples/nextjs-housing-assessment
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Record Video Demo (1 hour)

Follow `VIDEO_DEMO_SCRIPT.md`:
- 3-5 minutes total
- Show quick setup
- Demo housing assessment
- Explain architecture

### Step 6: Deploy (30 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Update README.md with live URL
```

### Step 7: Final Review (15 minutes)

- [ ] All files in English
- [ ] README has deploy links
- [ ] Video demo uploaded
- [ ] All examples work
- [ ] Submit to Zama!
